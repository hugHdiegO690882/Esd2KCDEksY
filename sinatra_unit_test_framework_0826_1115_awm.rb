# Sinatra application under test
class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  get '/' do
    'Hello World!'
  end

  get '/error' do
    raise 'Something went wrong'
  end
end

# Configuration
set :app, MyApp
set :environment, :test

# Unit tests
describe 'MyApp' do
  include Rack::Test::Methods

  before { app = MyApp.new }

  # Test for root path
  it 'responds to root path' do
    get '/'
    expect(last_response).to be_ok
    expect(last_response.body).to eq('Hello World!')
  end

  # Test for error handling
  it 'handles errors' do
    expect { get '/error' }.to raise_error(RuntimeError)
  end
end

# Note: This is a simple example of a Sinatra application with RSpec unit tests.
# It includes basic error handling and tests for root path and error handling.
# You can extend this example by adding more routes and tests as needed.
