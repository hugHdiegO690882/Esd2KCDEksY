# A simple Sinatra application for medical image analysis
class MedicalImageAnalysis < Sinatra::Base

  # Endpoint to receive medical images and return analysis
  get '/analyze' do
    # Check if the request contains an image file
    unless params['image']
      status 400
      return { error: 'No image file provided' }.to_json
    end

    # Analyze the image (this is a placeholder for the actual analysis logic)
    begin
      image = params['image']
      analysis_result = analyze_image(image)

      # Return the analysis result as JSON
      { result: analysis_result }.to_json
    rescue => e
      # Handle any exceptions that occur during analysis
      status 500
      { error: "Analysis failed: #{e.message}" }.to_json
    end
  end

  # Placeholder method for image analysis
  # This should be replaced with actual image processing logic
  def analyze_image(image)
    # For the sake of example, we're just returning a string
    # In a real-world scenario, this would involve processing the image
    # and returning meaningful analysis data
    "Image analyzed successfully"
  end

  # Run the application on port 4567
  run! if app_file == $0
end

# This is a simple example and does not include the actual image processing logic.
# In a real-world application, you would need to integrate with a medical image processing library or service.
