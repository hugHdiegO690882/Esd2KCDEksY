# Database Pool Manager for Sinatra using Ruby
# This script sets up a basic framework for managing a database connection pool
# using the Sinatra framework.

require 'sinatra'
require 'sequel'
require 'connection_pool'

# Database configuration
DB_CONFIG = {
  :adapter => 'sqlite',
  :database => 'my_database.db'
}

# Connection pool setup
DB_POOL = ConnectionPool.new(size: 5, timeout: 10) do
  # The block is evaluated each time a new connection is needed
  Sequel.connect(DB_CONFIG)
end

# Sinatra route to display database connection pool info
get '/' do
  # Retrieve the current database connection from the pool
  db = DB_POOL.with do |db_connection|
    "Current database connection: #{db_connection.opts[:database]}
"
  end
  "Database Pool Info: #{db}
"
end

# Sinatra route to test database connection
get '/test_connection' do
  begin
    # Retrieve the current database connection from the pool
    db = DB_POOL.with do |db_connection|
      # Perform a simple query to test the connection
      db_connection[:users].count
    end
    "Connection Test Successful. Number of users: #{db}
"
  rescue => e
    "Error testing connection: #{e.message}
"
  end
end

# Sinatra route to release a connection from the pool
get '/release_connection' do
  # The pool should handle releasing connections automatically,
  # but this route is here for demonstration purposes.
  DB_POOL.with do |db_connection|
    # No need to explicitly release connections in ConnectionPool
  end
  "Connection pool should manage connections automatically.
"
end

# Sinatra route to shutdown the app and release all connections
get '/shutdown' do
  # Shutdown the pool and release all connections
  DB_POOL.shutdown { |db_connection|
    db_connection.disconnect

  "Database connections released. App shutting down.
