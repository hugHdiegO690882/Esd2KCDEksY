# Consensus Algorithm Sinatra App
# This is a simple demonstration of a consensus algorithm in Ruby using Sinatra.
# It's important to note that this is a basic example and not a full consensus algorithm implementation.

# Enum for different states of the consensus algorithm
module ConsensusState
  PROPOSING = 'proposing'
  COMMITTING = 'committing'
  AGREED = 'agreed'
end

# Simple Consensus Algorithm class
class ConsensusAlgorithm
  attr_reader :state, :value
  
  # Initialize the consensus algorithm with a value
  def initialize(value = nil)
    @value = value
    @state = ConsensusState::PROPOSING
  end
  
  # Propose a new value
  def propose(value)
    raise 'Already agreed on a value' if @state == ConsensusState::AGREED
    @value = value
    @state = ConsensusState::PROPOSING
  end
  
  # Commit to the current value
  def commit
    raise 'Cannot commit without a proposed value' if @value.nil?
    @state = ConsensusState::COMMITTING
  end
  
  # Agree on the value
  def agree
    raise 'Cannot agree without committing' unless @state == ConsensusState::COMMITTING
    @state = ConsensusState::AGREED
  end
end

# Sinatra setup
get '/' do
  "Welcome to the Consensus Algorithm Sinatra App"
end

# Endpoint to propose a new value
post '/propose' do
  value = params['value']
  consensus = ConsensusAlgorithm.new
  consensus.propose(value)
  "Proposed value: #{value}"
end

# Endpoint to commit to the current value
post '/commit' do

  consensus.commit
  "Committed to value: #{consensus.value}"
